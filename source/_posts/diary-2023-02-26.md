Dear diary,

Today, I started recording what I learned throughout the day. 
Recently, I have been experimenting with Arduino. 
A few days ago, I had trouble getting it to work with the Arduino IDE package in VS Code, 
but I discovered a simpler way with the PlatformIO package.

Today, I attempted to use the Serial Monitor for debugging, but it did not function properly. 
After much googling, I found a solution. 
I had to modify the `platformio.ini` file by adding the following lines of code:

```ini
// platformio.ini

; Hack for Serial Monitor to work in VS Code
; https://community.platformio.org/t/cant-get-output-from-serial-monitor/15533/21
monitor_dtr = 0
monitor_rts = 0
```

I'm learning how to code in C++ and extract logic into a header file.
To do this, I created a `WiFi.h` file with function definitions and a guard at the beginning:

```cpp
#ifndef WIFI_H
#define WIFI_H

void WiFiConnect(String ssid, String password);

#endif
```

The guard helps to avoid multiple imports of the same file.
Next, I created a `WiFi.cpp` file with the actual function implementation, and included `#include "WiFi.h".`

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include "WiFi.h"

void WiFiConnect(String ssid, String password)
{
    if (!Serial.available())
    {
        Serial.begin(9600);
    }
    Serial.println();
    Serial.printf("Connecting to %s...", ssid.c_str());
    WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
    while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED)
    {
        delay(500);
        Serial.print(".");
    }
    Serial.println();
    Serial.printf("Connected, IP address %s", WiFi.localIP().toString().c_str());
}
```

Additionally, I learned how to store sensitive data in a separate `ini` file to avoid pushing it to git. 
First, I imported the `secrets.ini` file into the `platformio.ini` file and then added it to the `build_flags`:

```ini
[platformio]
extra_configs = secrets.in

[env:d1_mini]
; other config options
build_flags =
    -D WIFI_SSID=\"${secrets.WIFI_SSID}\"
    -D WIFI_PASSWORD=\"${secrets.WIFI_PASSWORD}\
```

Finally, I used the macros in my code:

```cpp
WiFiConnect(WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASSWORD);
```

Overall, it was a productive day of learning.

I'll try to keep writing about what I have learned every day.

I used ChatGPT to proof-read this post :D
